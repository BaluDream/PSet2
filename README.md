# Lesson Plan for camel
  ![Alt Text](camel-2-screenshot.png)
## Hints

* Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.

* Much like a list, a str is “iterable,” which means you can iterate over each of its characters in a loop. For instance, if s is a str, you could print each of its characters, one at a time, with code like:
      for c in s:
            print(c, end="")

## How to test

Here’s how to test your code manually:

* Run your program with python camel.py. Type name and press Enter. Your program should output:
  name  
* Run your program with python camel.py. Type firstName and press Enter. Your program should output:
  first_name
* Run your program with python camel.py. Type preferredFirstName and press Enter. Your program should output
  preferred_first_name



# Lesson Plan for Coke Machine

Suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca-Cola (Coke) for 50 cents and only accepts coins in these denominations: 25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents.

In a file called coke.py, implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers, and ignore any integer that isn’t an accepted denomination.

## How to test

Here’s how to test your code manually:

* Run your program with python coke.py. At your Insert Coin: prompt, type 25 and press Enter. Your program should output:
  Amount Due: 25
  and continue prompting the user for coins.
* Run your program with python coke.py. At your Insert Coin: prompt, type 10 and press Enter. Your program should output:
  Amount Due: 40
  and continue prompting the user for coins.
* Run your program with python coke.py. At your Insert Coin: prompt, type 5 and press Enter. Your program should output:
  Amount Due: 45
  and continue prompting the user for coins.
* Run your program with python coke.py. At your Insert Coin: prompt, type 30 and press Enter. Your program should output:
  Amount Due: 50
  because the machine doesn’t accept 30-cent coins! Your program should then continue prompting the user for coins.
* Run your program with python coke.py. At your Insert Coin: prompt, type 25 and press Enter, then type 25 again and press Enter. Your 
  program should halt and display:
  Change Owed: 0
* Run your program with python coke.py. At your Insert Coin: prompt, type 25 and press Enter, then type 10 and press Enter. Type 25 
  again and press Enter, after which your program should halt and display:
  Change Owed: 10




# Lesson Plan for Just setting up my twttr

![Alt Text](twttr-1-screenshot.png)

When texting or tweeting, it’s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.


## Hints

* Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.

* Much like a list, a str is “iterable,” which means you can iterate over each of its characters in a loop. For instance, if s is a str,
